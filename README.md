5 user stories - Routine Tracking App
As a user, I want to receive personalized routine suggestions based on my goals, interests, and available time so that I can easily discover and plan new daily or weekly routines.
As a user, I want to be able to create and customize my own routines by adding specific tasks, setting durations, and defining the frequency of each task, so that I can tailor my routines to my unique needs.
As a user, I want to be able to track my progress within my routines by marking completed tasks, setting reminders, and visualizing my performance over time, so that I can stay motivated and on track with my goals.
As a user, I want the app to provide insights and analytics on my routine performance, such as time spent on tasks and overall adherence, to help me make data-driven decisions on optimizing my routines for better results.
As a user, I want to have the option to share my routines and progress with friends or the community, as well as engage in social features like commenting on and liking others' routines, to foster a sense of accountability and mutual encouragement in achieving our goals.
